# Hello, I'm Alberto! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

I'm a passionate cloud and DevOps enthusiast. I have a regulatory analysis background and started my adventure in Cloud and DevOps with [The Bridge](https://www.thebridge.tech/?utm_medium=ppc&utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=GA_The+Bridge_Marca&utm_term=the%20bridge%20bootcamp&hsa_kw=the%20bridge%20bootcamp&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&hsa_cam=6496961935&hsa_ad=549241137266&hsa_acc=1272778203&hsa_src=g&hsa_grp=82036397030&hsa_mt=p&hsa_tgt=kwd-1287381892718&gclid=Cj0KCQjw06-oBhC6ARIsAGuzdw3wywTfvzIW39JlTTrYJZYpkwF0yUkijjEy_5Isn9yp4Dv70WAwjewaAu5zEALw_wcB).


My goal is to bring a differential value to the project by achieving the construction of scalable, accessible and effective cloud structures.
