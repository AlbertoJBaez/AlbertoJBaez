# Hello, I'm Alberto! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

I'm a passionate cloud and DevOps enthusiast. 

I have a regulatory analysis background and started my adventure in Cloud and DevOps with [The Bridge](https://www.thebridge.tech/?utm_medium=ppc&utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=GA_The+Bridge_Marca&utm_term=the%20bridge%20bootcamp&hsa_kw=the%20bridge%20bootcamp&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&hsa_cam=6496961935&hsa_ad=549241137266&hsa_acc=1272778203&hsa_src=g&hsa_grp=82036397030&hsa_mt=p&hsa_tgt=kwd-1287381892718&gclid=Cj0KCQjw06-oBhC6ARIsAGuzdw3wywTfvzIW39JlTTrYJZYpkwF0yUkijjEy_5Isn9yp4Dv70WAwjewaAu5zEALw_wcB).


My goal is to bring a differential value to the project by achieving the construction of scalable, accessible and effective cloud structures. 


I also aim to contribute with processes simplification and automatization to make deployments more efficient and reliable. 


I am currently eager to add value and take on new challenges related to cloud technology from a DevOps perspective.


## My Interests

I love working with tools and technologies related to:

- **Cloud Computing:** AWS, Azure, GCP.
- **Container Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform, CloudFormation.
- **Automation:** Ansible.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Jenkins, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD, Azure DevOps.
- **Monitoring and Observability:** AWS CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, GC Logging, Azure Monitor.

## My Projects

Here you'll find a selection of my most recent projects.

### Main Projects

Relevant projects deploying global cloud computing skills.

- [Cloud & Devops Bootcamp final project](https://github.com/desafioteam1): This is an end-of-course project, developed by professionals diverse IT fields in order to solve a problem raised in a brief and value the experience of each area.

  [My input](https://github.com/AlbertoJBaez/Cloud-Input-Final-Project):

  - Building a scalable, secure and efficient cloud architecture design for the project's automation system.

  - Automatic version synchronization and continuous systems and application deployment.
    
  - Check the [Cloud Project](https://github.com/AlbertoJBaez/Cloud-Input-Final-Project).
 

### Side Projects

Minor projects focused on skills building.

- [Flask on VS Code tutorial](https://github.com/AlbertoJBaez/python-sample-vscode-flask-tutorial): A VS Code official tutorial on how to fluently work with flask on VS. A simple Flask application with three pages utilizing a shared base template is crafted. Throughout the tutorial, various aspects of Visual Studio Code are explored, encompassing the terminal, editor, debugger, code snippets, and additional functionalities

- [Azure Container Registry project](https://github.com/AlbertoJBaez/acr-build-helloworld-node): A Node.js application is used to demonstrate scenarios for Azure Container Registry Tasks. ACR Tasks is a suite of features within Azure Container Registry that enables Docker container builds on Azure, as well as automated OS and framework patching for Docker containers.

- [Building a sample web using Dockerfile and Kubernetes](https://github.com/AlbertoJBaez/pipelines-javascript-docker): This code sample uses the Node.js web framework Express to create a basic web server using a Docker container image. The code sample also includes .yml files to deploy the containerized Node.JS application to a Kubernetes cluster.

- [App users creation using MongoDB](https://github.com/AlbertoJBaez/users-app): This is a project built using the MERN Full Stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. MongoDB is used as the database and Mongoose is used to interact with it. Mongoose provides a simple and easy to use interface to perform CRUD operations on the database. Credits to my bootcamp partner: @GabrielaSpace.

- [App deployment using React and NodeJS on AWS ECS](https://github.com/AlbertoJBaez/react-nodejs-ecs): Example Project for deploying React app with NodeJS API on AWS ECS.



## Continuous Learning

I'm always looking to learn and grow in my field. Currently, I'm deepening my skills on:

- [Terraform](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-terraform/). Terraform is essential to manage Infrastructure as a Code in cloud environment. I am currently taking this course to improve the aquired bootcamp skills. 
- [Python](https://www.pildorasinformaticas.es/course/curso-python/curriculum/). I was eager to take a full pyhton course from scratch although I have already widely worked with it. I am aiming to master the basics and middle level skills to be fully confident on an working environment.
